        "# Python OOPs Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Object-Oriented Programming is like building your program out of little story-characters that know how to behave, remember things, and interact with each other. Instead of writing everything as one long script, you create well-behaved “objects” that each have a clear role in the tale.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "->A class in Object-Oriented Programming is the blueprint used to create objects. It’s the design, the template, the master plan. Objects are the actual things made from that plan.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Attributes (data/variables)\n",
        "\n",
        ".Methods (functions/behaviors)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in oop\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An object in OOP is the living, breathing (well, digitally) result created from a class.\n",
        "If a class is the blueprint, then an object is the finished house you can walk into\n",
        "\n",
        ".Actual data\n",
        "\n",
        ".Functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "->Abstraction and encapsulation are like two friendly guardians of clean code. They work together but protect different things inside your program’s little universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is about showing only what’s necessary and hiding the rest.\n",
        "Think of it as a well-behaved interface that says,\n",
        "\"Use me without worrying about my internal gears.\"\n",
        "\n",
        " Focus: Hiding complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Makes the user see only the important features\n",
        "\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "When you press the start button in a car, you don’t care how fuel mixes with air or how circuits chirp to life. You only see “Car starts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is about wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to that data.\n",
        "It’s like keeping important things in a vault and giving access through controlled doors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus: Protecting data\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Prevents direct, unsafe access to internal details\n",
        "\n",
        "Tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "Private variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Getters & setters\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Dunder methods are Python’s secret trapdoors, marked with double underscores on both sides. They let your objects behave like native Python features, almost as if the class is learning ancient spells\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "->Inheritance in OOP is the art of letting one class borrow the strengths of another so it doesn’t have to start life from scratch. It’s like a new character in a story receiving a well-packed trunk of abilities, traits, and tools from an older character.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism is the elegant talent in OOP that lets the same action take different forms depending on who performs it. It’s like giving a single word to several characters and watching each one express it in their own voice.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Encapsulation in Python is achieved by protecting data inside a class and offering controlled doorways to access it.\n",
        "\n",
        "9What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A constructor is a special method named __init__ that runs automatically when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "->\n",
        "- A class method is tied to the class itself, not to individual objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A static method is like a quiet helper that sits inside the class but doesn’t depend on the class or any object.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "->Method overloading in Python is a bit of a curious creature. In languages like Java or C++, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python, however, prefers to travel light and doesn’t support true method overloading in that strict sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method overriding is the moment when a child class looks at a method inherited from its parent and says,\n",
        "“I appreciate the gift, but I’ll use my own version.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A property decorator in Python is a graceful way to turn a method into an attribute-like interface. It lets your class expose data cleanly while still keeping full control behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism is important in OOP because it lets your code behave like a well-trained orchestra: one signal, many instruments responding in their own beautiful way.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An abstract class in Python is like a blueprint that refuses to be built directly. It lays down the rules, the skeleton, the “must-have” behaviors, but leaves the actual details for its children to fill in.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "->Object-Oriented Programming comes with a basket of advantages that make software feel organized, flexible, and expandable.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A class variable and an instance variable are like two types of belongings inside a class:\n",
        "one belongs to every object together, and the other belongs to each object individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "->Multiple inheritance in Python is when a class learns its skills from more than one parent. It’s like a character in a story raised by two different masters, inheriting techniques from both.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "-> __str__ and __repr__ are Python’s two storytelling methods.\n",
        "They decide how your object introduces itself — whether it speaks casually to users or formally to developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "-> super() in Python is like calling your parent class on a cosmic hotline. It lets a child class tap into its parent’s powers without naming the parent directly, keeping everything clean and future-proof.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> __del__ is Python’s quiet curtain-closing method. It’s called when an object is about to disappear, giving it one last moment to tidy up before it vanishes from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-> 1. @staticmethod — The method with no strings attached\n",
        "\n",
        "A staticmethod doesn't take self or cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "It behaves like a regular function that simply lives inside a class for organizational convenience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points\n",
        "\n",
        "No access to instance (self)\n",
        "\n",
        "No access to class (cls)\n",
        "\n",
        "Pure utility function\n",
        "\n",
        "- @classmethod — The method that knows the class\n",
        "\n",
        "A classmethod takes cls as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "It works with the class itself, not an individual object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points\n",
        "\n",
        "Has access to class variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Can modify class state\n",
        "\n",
        "Often used as factory methods\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "->Polymorphism in Python becomes especially lively when inheritance enters the scene.\n",
        "A parent class offers a method, and each child class reshapes that method in its own voice. When you call the method on different objects, each object responds according to its own identity, even though the call looks the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "->Method chaining in Python is a smooth conversational dance between methods, where each one politely hands the object back so the next method can continue the story.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "->__call__ gives an object the power to behave like a function.\n",
        "Once this method is defined, you can call the object itself using parentheses, and it responds just like a callable creature."
